# PAW App
This repository contains the desktop application for PAW (Puppy's Avatar World), a VRChat avatar database and search platform.

## Overview
The application is built using Tauri and Next.js. It provides a native desktop experience for searching, browsing, and discovering VRChat avatars.  A key feature of the application is the ability to "force clone" avatars you have encountered directly from within the app.
